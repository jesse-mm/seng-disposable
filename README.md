## Documentation

View the [generated documentation](https://rawgit.com/MediaMonks/seng-boilerplate/master/doc/typedoc/index.html).


## Building

In order to build seng-boilerplate, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/MediaMonks/seng-boilerplate.git
```

Change to the seng-boilerplate directory:
```
cd seng-boilerplate
```

Install dev dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Use one of the following main scripts:
```
npm run build   		# build this project (done on install)
npm run typings			# install .d.ts dependencies (done on install)
npm test    			# run the tests
npm validate			# runs validation scripts, including test, lint and doc
npm run lint			# run tslint on this project
npm run doc				# generate typedoc and yuidoc documentation
npm run typescript-npm	# just compile the typescript output used in the npm module
```

When installing this module, it adds a pre-commit hook, that runs the `validate`
and `build` scripts before committing, so you can be sure that everything
checks out and all files that should be committed are generated.
